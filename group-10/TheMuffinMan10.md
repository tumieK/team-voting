## Highlights

Details of the highlights of the week: 
Working with team members that have significalty more experience than me. I felt left behind but I made it my duty to catch up and I would say that I kinda did. Given the amount of time.

## Difficulties

Details of low points and difficulties during the week
The first day was really tough. I felt ineffably left behind and that this task was beyond my finite capabilities. Fortunately we pulled through in the end.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

Details of how you think we can make the vacation work week more effective and fun next year.
I think it would be really great if you guys built the project (or at least got someone to do it) and showcase it as an example during the briefing.
